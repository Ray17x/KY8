# KY8, A TUI Music Player (for linux machines) with advanced DSP configuration(s) and other features
KY8, as the title suggests, is a more advanced music player that priortizes customizing DSP (i.e equalizing, hard -6Db limiting, Resampling, etc.) As the lead developer of this project, I've come to learn that many music players I've used don't have easily accesible options for changing how my music sounds with an equalizer. Fooyin was not up to my expectations when it came to replacing foobar2k on my windows system so I decided to take things into my own hands and build my own music player with the JUCE Framework in order to adjust equalization and other stuff.
